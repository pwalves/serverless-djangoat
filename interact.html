        The light shining through the cracked window wakes you up. Your straw bed rustles as you shift your weight to get out. After getting dressed you open the creaky pine door and head downstairs. The innkeeper that was kind enough to give you a room late last night waves you over to the bar. “Good morning bleeping beauty. What’ll you have?”

You make your way over to the corner and notice that the air seems to have gotten more damp. The legs of the chairs have developed mold growths. You look back towards the bar and notice that the innkeeper walked into the kitchen to get your food. The rest of the room is flooded with morning light, but this corner remains oppressively dark.", 
                "“Ha! Breakfast of champions huh?” The innkeeper turns around and fills a worn mug with ale from the keg behind the counter. He sets it down on the bar counter sending the beer inside sloshing. Taking the mug by the handle you take an astonishing large swig. The innkeeper smiles at you, “So when are you goin’ to start the job?”", 
                "The innkeeper’s shoulders sag and he sighs, “We have plenty to choose from, but suit yourself.” You gather yourself and start to stride away from the counter. “Where do you think you’re going?” The innkeeper raises his voice, “ We had an agreement.”"];

You notice the innkeeper coming towards you with a loaf of bread and a small wedge of cheese on a wooden board. You can see the steam in the sunlight, but as he walks into the corner the vapors disappear. “Fresh from the oven, enjoy” The innkeeper’s smile is the only warmth in the corner, “Now, let’s talk business. I didn’t take you in last night for charity. I still have the trouble in my basement you need to deal with.”", 
             "“Oh, that corner? Some magician or enchanter or warlock or some such thing cast a type of enclosure curse over there. It took A LOT of coin to get that place looking as good as that. It’s become one of my customers’ favorite places though. It’s next to impossible for anyone who’s not at that table to hear you, almost like you’re in a separate room. Once your skin stops crawling it’s not too bad. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about the basement job.”", 
             "You get up to leave the oppressive table. As you get closer to the door, you seem to be pulled back. You stop for a second to look behind you, and the table seems to be about 3 yards away, and looking forward the oak is only a yard away. Chalking it up to the dampness, you continue to the door. You can’t seem to get closer, it’s still a yard away but it looks like the distance to the table doubled. A chuckle echoes from the bar counter."],

The dampness of the corner is getting heavier. “I hope you enjoyed your stay.” It’s getting harder to breathe. The few puffs you can muster form misty clouds in the air. The mist starts condensing and falls to the ground as ice pellets. “I’m sorry.” Your chest is too heavy to rise and you can feel a chilling, stabbing pain in your throat and lungs. By the time your fingertips become cold you’re on the floor, frozen from the inside out.",

I’d do it myself, but a good bunch of them are under the stairs and my back’d kill me if I tried.” He hands you a broom and you set off down the wooden stairs. He didn’t give you a lantern, but it doesn’t look like it’s a problem. A greenish light is streaming in from somewhere. At the base of the steps you still fail to find the source of the light. For a basement, it’s very spacious and warm. Under the stairs you find a few spider webs, but hardly enough to be a “trouble”. A few minutes later you finish swatting the webs, and turn around to leave. The light appears to be getting brighter, and the space is getting warmer. At the base of the stairs you look up and fail to spot the door. In a panic you look around and the wide open basement has constricted. The light is getting brighter. Two at a time you run up the stairs, until you arrive at a smooth brick wall. Your hands, sweaty from the now intense heat, desperately seek a handle since your eyes have become useless in the light.
